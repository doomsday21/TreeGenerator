# TreeGenerator

This TreeGenerator was built as an project along with Anusha Fatima () for our Functional Data Structures course in 4th Semester at Habib University.

Our goal was to basically develop a visualizer for data structures. Currently this supports Binary Trees, BSTs and RB Trees. 

"The user inputs the integers in a particular order and input which data strucuture they want and then our program will generate it's latex code for visualising it. When the code is complied, a visual description of the data is seen in the pdf document created for example an image of a binary trees with nodes , their values and their connections."
